## Development

### Run locally

1. Install relevant dependencies with `npm install`
2. Run using `npm run start`
3. Should be accessible using http://localhost:3000/

### Test using node-dojo

To run before committing, runs the tests and accessibility tests within the node-dojo environment.

If a new page needs testing, add it to the array of URLs in the `.pa11yci.json` file.

```bash
# Installs relevant dependencies
npm install

# Runs tests in node-dojo
./tasks test

# Runs tests with coverage in node-dojo
./tasks test_coverage

# Runs accessibility tests in node-dojo
./tasks test_accessibility

# Runs end to end tests in node-dojo
./tasks test_functional
```
